# RAG Learning Project

This project demonstrates a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline along with document parsing and structured data extraction.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how RAG systems work in practice by building the foundational components step by step.

## What This Project Includes

- PDF parsing using PyMuPDF
- Document structure detection using regular expressions
- Conversion of parsed content into structured JSON format
- Conceptual design of a complete RAG pipeline (Ingestion + Retrieval)

## Project Flow

PDF → Data Parsing → Structured Sections → JSON Output → RAG Architecture

## Files in This Repository

- app.py – Python script for document parsing
- Simple_Data_Parsing_and_Document_Structure.pdf – Original document
- structured_output.json – Structured JSON output
- RAG.pdf – Explanation of complete RAG pipeline

## Learning Focus

Currently exploring Agentic AI systems and building practical projects around LLMs and RAG architectures.

Open to feedback and suggestions.
